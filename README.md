# Steno Dictionaries

This repository contains Monniasza’s personal stenography dictionaries for private use. The dictionaries are in JSON format and use [Plover](http://stenoknight.com/wiki/FAQ#What_is_Plover.3F) theory. These descend from Di's dictionaries, with Monniasza's individual changes applied.
These are not suited for use by anyone else, because these reflect Monniasza's individual habits, but they may provide insights for anyone else

# How to use these dictionaries

If you want to use the dictionaries in this repo instead of Plover's, you have 2 main options. 

The first option is that you can download each individual dictionary you want and add it to your own collection of dictionaries and turn each on in your Plover config as you need. Over time, there will be new entries in these dictionaries, so you may wish to download them again or look at the history for each file and decide what new entries you want to add manually.

The second option is to clone the repository and turn on each dictionary you want in your Plover config as you need. Over time, when there are new entries, you can "pull" the latest changes.

## Which dictionaries to use

You will likely only want some of the dictionaries in this repo. You can read more about each elsewhere on this page. I recommend at a minimum:

- 1 large dictionary for vocabulary, such as [`dict.json`](https://github.com/didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries/blob/master/dictionaries/dict.json).
- 1 fingerspelling dictionary, such as [`fingerspelling.json`](dictionaries/fingerspelling.json).
- 1 numbers dictionary, such as [`numbers.json`](https://github.com/didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries/blob/master/dictionaries/numbers.json).
- 1 punctuation dictionary, such as [`punctuation.json`](dictionaries/punctuation.json).

I would also suggest dictionaries to operate Plover and your computer, such as:

- [`plover-use.json`](dictionaries/plover-use.json).
- [`computer-use.json`](dictionaries/computer-use.json).
- [`navigation.json`](dictionaries/navigation.json).
- [`tabbing.json`](dictionaries/tabbing.json).
- [`modifiers-single-stroke.json`](dictionaries/modifiers-single-stroke.json).

You *could* also add `condensed-strokes.json` and `condensed-strokes-fingerspelled.json` to improve lookups (see [## Vocabulary Dictionaries](#vocabulary-dictionaries)), but they can cause [spacing issues](https://github.com/didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries/issues/174) in rare fingerspelling situations.

> A misstroke is like a "chord typo". It's when you mean to write one chord, but stroke another. Often, dictionaries have misstroke entries that are added when a stenographer frequently misstrokes an entry. For example, take the stroke TKPWAOD (meaning GAOD) which translates to good. Sometimes the stenographer may miss a key, so they could have a misstroke entry TKPAOD which would also translate to good. Then they are protected from these typos in regular writing. There are many misstroke entries in the default dictionary, and you must try to make sense of results when you look up words, instead of blindly accepting the shortest stroke.
— [Plover project glossary](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover/wiki/Glossary#misstroke)

**The aim is to remove all the misstrokes from `dict.json` to give new stenographers greater confidence in learning new briefs.** The first step is to remove all the misstrokes for the *shortest* available brief for every word. If there’s a misstroke in a longer word, it is less likely to be suggested by Typey Type or dictionary look up tools.

If you notice any misstrokes, see the [Contributing guide](#contributing) below.

† This dictionary contains fingerspelling entries for writing words. In rare situations, the fingerspelled entries can cause [spacing issues](https://github.com/didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries/issues/174).

## English Dictionaries

- A main [`dict.json`](https://github.com/didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries/raw/master/dictionaries/dict.json) dictionary, containing many English words using briefs and phonetic strokes, but contains fewer misstrokes.

## Plover dictionaries

The main [plover-use.json](dictionaries/plover-use.json) helps you use the Plover app itself as well as managing spacing and casing in Plover:

- `"TPHR*URB": "{}",`: [Cancels formatting of next word](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover/wiki/Dictionary-Format#canceling-formatting-of-next-word)
- `"KPA*EU: {^}{&lt;}`: suppresses a space and forces the next letter to be uppercase
- `"KW-GS: {~|\"^}`: carries the capital letter across the next quotation mark
- `"KR-GS: {^~|\"}`: carries the capital letter across the next quotation mark
- `"PREPB: {~|(^}`: carries the capital letter across the next parenthesis
- `"PR*EPB: {^~|)}`: carries the capital letter across the next parenthesis
- `"K-BGS: {MODE:CAMEL}`: switches to camelCase mode so spaces are suppressed and subsequent words are capitalised
- `"KHRAO*ER: {MODE:CLEAR}`: clears all mode settings
- `"KPHA*PLD: {MODE:SET_SPACE:, }`: sets a custom space mode that replaces all spaces with spaces (normal spacing—you can swap the space character for any character)
- `"SPAO*EUPBL: {MODE:LOWER} {MODE:SET_SPACE:-}`: switches to lowercase mode and sets the spaces to hyphens for a kind of “spinal case”
- `"STPHA*EUBG: {MODE:SNAKE}`: switches to snake case mode so all spaces are replaces with underscores

[commmands.json](dictionaries/commands.json):
- `"#: {*+}`: repeats the previous stroke
- `"#*: {*}`: toggles the asterisk key on the previous stroke
-`"WUZ": {#}`: separates briefs to prevent word boundary errors

[commands-capmode.json](dictionaries/commands-capmode.json) - case and mode commands:
- `"HRO*ER": {&gt;}`: forces the first letter of the next word to be lowercase
- `"HRO*ERD": {*&gt;}`: forces the first letter of the previous word to be lowercase
- `"HRO*ERS": {MODE:LOWER}`: switches to lowercase mode so all letters are lowercase
- `"KA*PL": {&lt;}`: uppercases the next word
- `"KA*PS": {MODE:CAPS}`: switches to all caps or uppercase mode so all letters are uppercase
- `"KA*PD": {*&lt;}`: retrospectively capitalise/uppercase word
- `"KPA*L": {-|}`: Capitalises/uppercases first letter of the next word
- `"KPA*S": {MODE:TITLE}`: switches to title case mode so all all words start with capital letters
- `"KPA*D": {*-|}`: retrospectively capitalise/uppercase first letter
- `"TPH-S": {^^}`: suppresses an upcoming space
- `"TPH-SZ": {MODE:SET_SPACE:}`: glues all subsequent strokes together
- `"AFPS: {*?}`: retrospectively inserts a space
- `"TK-FPS: {*!}`: retrospectively remove space
- `"R*EFDZ: {MODE:RESET_CASE}`: resets case modes
- `"R*EFTS: {MODE:RESET_SPACE}`: resets spacing modes
- `"RE*FTSDZ*": {MODE:RESET}`: resets all case and spacing modes

[commands-plover.json](dictionaries/commands-plover.json):
- `"TKUPT": "{PLOVER:ADD_TRANSLATION}",`: opens Plover’s add translation window
- `"PHRAOBG": "{PLOVER:LOOKUP}",`: opens Plover’s lookup window
- `"PHREUG": "{PLOVER:CONFIGURE}",`: opens Plover’s configuration
- `"PHREUT/PHREUT": "{PLOVER:QUIT}",`: quits Plover’s
- `"PHROEUBGS": "{PLOVER:FOCUS}",`: brings Plover to the front (window focus)
- `"PHROF": "{PLOVER:SUSPEND}",`: disables Plover’s steno behaviour
- `"PHROLG": "{PLOVER:TOGGLE}",`: toggles Plover’s steno behaviour between on and off
- `"PHROPB": "{PLOVER:RESUME}",`: enables Plover’s steno behaviour

## Vocabulary Dictionaries

- [`nouns.json`](https://github.com/didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries/raw/master/dictionaries/nouns.json) contains a few hundred additional words.
- [`proper-nouns.json`](https://github.com/didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries/raw/master/dictionaries/proper-nouns.json) contains a few hundred proper nouns.
- [`condensed-strokes.json`](https://github.com/didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries/raw/master/dictionaries/condensed-strokes.json) contains a combinations of existing strokes in the main Plover dictionary so that they appear in searches when you look up strokes. These words can already be written using the default Plover dictionary and prefix/suffix strokes or punctuation strokes. It can be useful for improving dictionary lookups, but is not needed to write the words. It can cause [spacing issues](https://github.com/didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries/issues/174) in rare situations so you may want to add it to your Plover config in a certain order so that it is overwritten by the other dictionaries.

## Navigation and Tabbing Dictionaries

This dictionary lets you navigate and edit text efficiently on a Mac. You can move the cursor by letter, word, or line, select while doing so, and also backspace or forward delete by character, word, or line.

To use the following briefs, copy the [`navigation.json`](https://github.com/didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries/raw/master/dictionaries/navigation.json) file into your dictionary folder and add it to your Plover config:

As per Plover's default, you use `-R`, `-P`, `-B`, and `-G` for left, up, down, and right.

Use `STPH-` to move by character, `STPH-RB` to jump a word left, and `STPH-BG` to jump a word right.

Use `KPH-` to use Command ⌘, jumping to line beginning and ending, file top and bottom.

Use `STP-` (**s**hi**f**t) to select characters with movement keys. Again, `-RB` and `-BG` work by word.

Use `SHR-` (**s**e**l**ect) to select words with the movement keys. (This and the strokes described above actually add redundant strokes for selecting whole words to the left and right.)

Use `PW*` and `-F`, `-FP`, or `-FPL` for backspacing a character, a word, or a line.

Use `PW*` and `-R`, `-RB`, or `-RBG` for forward deleting a character, a word, or a line.

Use `KPHR-` for Command + Option (⌘⌥) movements (usually for navigating tabs and file trees).

Use `SP-B` to space up/forward and `SP-P` to space down/backward. That is, in the browser use the former stroke to page up and the latter to page down (this is using ⇧Space).

Use `THRAB` for ⌥ ⇓ and `THRAP` for ⌥ ⇑.

The complementary [`tabbing.json`](https://github.com/didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries/raw/master/dictionaries/navigation.json) dictionary also lets you switch tabs, windows, and apps.

Use `TW-` and a direction for tabbing.

- Adding `-F`/`-L` gives you <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>⇧</kbd><kbd>[</kbd> / <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>⇧</kbd><kbd>]</kbd> to switch tabs forward and backward.
- Adding `-B`/`-P` gives you <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>\`</kbd> / <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>⇧</kbd><kbd>\`</kbd> to switch windows forward and backward.
- Adding `-G`/`-R` gives you <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>Tab</kbd> / <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>⇧</kbd><kbd>Tab</kbd> to switch applications forward and backward.
- Adding `-FB`/`-LG` gives you <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>[</kbd> / <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>]</kbd> to navigate forwards and backwards in a browser.
- Adding a star to `TW*G` gives you <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>Tab</kbd><kbd>Tab</kbd> to switch 2 applications.

## Computer Powerups Dictionary

This dictionary was designed for running commands on a Mac. Copy the [`computer-powerups.json`](https://github.com/didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries/raw/master/dictionaries/computer-powerups.json) file into your dictionary folder and add it to your Plover config to use the following briefs:

* Tab and Space keys `"STA*PB": "{#Tab}{#space}",`
* Mac Character Viewer `"KHA*RZ": "{#Control_L(Super_L(space))}",`
* Shift Return key (⇧↵) `"STP*R": "{#Shift_L(Return)}",`
* Command slash (⌘/) `"KPHOEU": "{#Super_L(slash)}{^}",`
    * to show keyboard shortcuts in many apps
    * to comment out code
    * to show cursor in iTerm
    * to show quick action command search in Figma
* Command Shift slash (⌘⇧/) `"KPHO*EU": "{#Super_L(Shift_L(slash))}",` — kind of like ⌘?
    * to show help
* Command backslash (⌘\) `"O*EURPLT": "{#Super_L(backslash)}",`
    * to show 1Password
* Command Shift backslash (⌘⇧\) `"O*EURPBLT": "{#Super_L(Shift_L(backslash))}",` — kind of like ⌘|
    * to emoji reply on Slack
* Audio play `"PHRA*EU": "{#AudioPlay}",`
* Audio raise volume `"SROPL": "{#AudioRaiseVolume}",`
* Audio lower volume `"SRO*PL": "{#AudioLowerVolume}",`
* Audio next `"TPH*EGT": "{#AudioNext}",`
* Audio mute `"PHAO*UT": "{#AudioMute}",`
* Monitor brightness up `"PWROEUT": "{#MonBrightnessUp}",`
* Monitor brightness down `"PWRO*EUT": "{#MonBrightnessDown}",`
* Keyboard brightness up `"KPWROEUT": "{#KbdBrightnessDown}",`
* Keyboard brightness down `"KPWRO*EUT": "{#KbdBrightnessUp}",`
* Command Escape `"KPH*/TPEFBG": "{#Super_L(Escape)}",`
* Command Space `"-FRL": "{#Super_L(space)} {^}",`
* Command Space (alternative) `"A*FRL": "{#Super_L(space)} {^}",`
* Command Option C (⌘⌥C) to copy from clipboard history `"KPWR*": "{#command(option(c))}",`
* Command Return `"KPHR*R": "{#command(return)}",`
* Control Space `"SP-LT": "{#Control_L(space)}{^}",`
* Option Escape for Speak selected text `"SPAO*EBG": "{#Alt_L(Escape)}",`
* Screenshot selected area as a file `"SKR*PB": "{#Super_L(Shift_L(4))}",`
* Screenshot selected area and copy to clipboard `"SKR*RPB": "{#Super_L(Control_L(Shift_L(4)))}",`

There are a handful of weird entries mapped to hard-to-hit QWERTY shortcuts like `"{#Control_L(Alt_L(Super_L(Shift_L(i))))}",` that are used by other applications, such as [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) and [Keymou](https://manytricks.com/keymou/), to map to the shortcuts to other behaviours.

### Mouse keys via keymou:

These outlines are designed to be used with [Keymou](https://manytricks.com/keymou/) to operate the mouse via keys or add keyboard modifiers to mouse behaviour. They tend to use left-hand only steno keys because I use the mouse with my right hand.

* ⌘ click to select multiple items individually: `"KPH": "{#Control_L(Alt_L(Super_L(Shift_L(8))))}",`
* ⌘ click to select multiple items individually: `"KPHRAO": "{#Control_L(Alt_L(Super_L(Shift_L(8))))}",`
* ⌘ click to select multiple items individually: `"KPHREUBG": "{#Control_L(Alt_L(Super_L(Shift_L(8))))}",`
* ⇧ click to select multiple items in a row: `"SPH": "{#Control_L(Alt_L(Super_L(Shift_L(7))))}",`
* ⇧ click to select multiple items in a row: `"STPHREUBG": "{#Control_L(Alt_L(Super_L(Shift_L(7))))}",`
* ⌥ click to select alternative options e.g. expanded WIFI details: `"THRA": "{#Control_L(Alt_L(Super_L(Shift_L(6))))}",`
* ⌥ click to select alternative options e.g. expanded WIFI details: `"THRA*": "{#Control_L(Alt_L(Super_L(Shift_L(6))))}",`
* Press and hold ⇧ for Shift + drag to move elements in a straight line: `"STP": "{#Control_L(Alt_L(Super_L(Shift_L(5))))}",`
* Press and hold ⌥ for Option + drag to duplicate elements: `"TKRAO": "{#Control_L(Alt_L(Super_L(Shift_L(9))))}",`
* Release mouse button: `"TKRAOD": "{#Control_L(Alt_L(Super_L(Shift_L(0))))}",`
* Release mouse button: `"STKRAO": "{#Control_L(Alt_L(Super_L(Shift_L(0))))}",`


## Punctuation Dictionary

Copy the [`punctuation.json`](https://github.com/didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries/raw/master/dictionaries/punctuation.json) file into your dictionary folder and add it to your Plover config to use the following briefs:

Note: I've prefer this entry for minus from Plover's original dictionary but it's since been replaced by "mountains" so it does not live in the punctuation dictionary:

* - `PH*PBS` =&gt; `M-NS` (<strong>m</strong>i<strong>n</strong>u<strong>s</strong>, spaced)

### Punctuation Powerups Dictionary

- [`punctuation-powerups.json`](https://github.com/didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries/raw/master/dictionaries/punctuation-powerups.json) contains additional punctuation briefs such as:
    - suppressed space pairs of punctuation (`"PWRABGS": "{^}<>{#Left}{^}"`),
    - spaces pairs of punctuation (`"STP-PLS": "''{#Left}{^}"`),
    - smart/curly quotation marks (`"TP-L/TP-L": "{^’}"`), and
    - punctuation that carries capitalisation  (`"KW-GS": "{~|“^}"`).

## Unspaced Punctuation Dictionary

This dictionary uses common briefs for punctuation, but with translations that suppress surrounding spaces (before and after the punctuation) for more precise input. This might be handy for programming, for example.

To use the following briefs, copy the [`punctuation-unspaced.json`](https://github.com/didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries/raw/master/dictionaries/punctuation-unspaced.json) file into your dictionary folder and add it to your Plover config:

* `EPB/TKA*RB`: –
* `EPL/TKA*RB`: —
* `KH-FG`: \`
* `KR-RT`: ^
* `KA*RT`: ^
* `T*LD`: ~
* `T*EULD`: ~
* `AEPBGT`: <
* `AEPBG`: <
* `A*EPBGT`: >
* `A*EPBG`: >
* `HR*PB`: <
* `TKPWR*PB`: >
* `PWRABG`: <
* `PWRA*BG`: >
* `KWA*LS`: =
* `KW-L`: =
* `KW-LS`: ==
* `KW*LS`: ===
* `PAO*EUP`: \|
* `R*UPB`: _
* `R*UPBD`: _
* `RUPBD`: _
* `H-PB`: -
* `TK-RB`: --
* `OEU`: /
* `SPWHRAERB`: \
* `P-P`: .
* `HR-PS`: ...
* `A*E`: '
* `AE`: '
* `KW-GS`: "
* `KR-GS`: "
* `PREPB`: (
* `PR*EPB`: )
* `PWR*BGT`: ]
* `PWR-BGT`: [
* `TPR-BGT`: {
* `TPR*BGT`: }
* `TK-PL`: $
* `STA*R`: *
* `SP-PBD`: &
* `HAERB`: #
* `PERS`: %
* `PHR*US`: +

Note: I prefer this entry for “minus” from Plover's original dictionary, which has since been replaced by "mountains", but I include it in punctuation-powerups and punctuation-unspaced:

* `PH*PBS`: - =&gt; `M-NS` (<strong>m</strong>i<strong>n</strong>u<strong>s</strong>, spaced)

There is an additional stroke for an unspaced double quotation mark combining the opening and closing double quotation mark briefs:

* `KWR-GS`: "

You might then remove the usual strokes for opening and closing double quotation marks from your dictionary so you can still use these marks with spacing on demand. You might also replace these entries with smart or curly double quotation marks, for example:

```
"KW-GS": "{“^}",
"KR-GS": "{^”}",
```

You could then write `Test “test” test.` using `KPA* TEFT KW-GS TEFT KR-GS TEFT TP-PL`.

Similarly with single quotation marks (not included in this dictionary):

```
"TP-P": "{‘^}",
"TP-L": "{^’}",

## Symbols Dictionaries

- [`symbols.json`](https://github.com/didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries/raw/master/dictionaries/symbols.json) contains common symbols, such as degrees (`"SPWO*L/TKEGS": "°"`) and trademark (`"SPWO*L/TRAEUD/PHARBG": "{^}™"`). All of the entries are prefixed with a “symbol” stroke, `"SPWO*L": "{#}"`. The remainder of each entry’s stroke uses the stroke that would write the word instead of the symbol (for example, `"TRAEUD/PHARBG": "trademark",` and `"TKEGS": "degrees"`).
- [`symbols-briefs.json`](https://github.com/didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries/raw/master/dictionaries/symbols-briefs.json) contains briefs for symbols, such as `"TK*EGS": "°"`.
- [`symbols-currency.json`](https://github.com/didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries/raw/master/dictionaries/symbols-currency.json) contains briefs for currency symbols, such as cent (`"SPWO*L/KREPBT": "¢"`) and dollar (`"SPWO*L/TKHRAR": "$"`). All of the entries are prefixed with a “symbol” stroke, `"SPWO*L": "{#}"`. The remainder of each entry’s stroke uses the stroke that would write the word instead of the symbol (for example, `"KREPBT": "cent"` and `"TKHRAR": "dollar"`).
- [`symbols-currency-culled.json`](https://github.com/didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries/raw/master/dictionaries/symbols-currency-culled.json) contains only these currency symbols:

```json
"SPWO*L/KREPBT": "¢",
"SPWO*L/TKHRAR": "$",
"SPWO*L/*EUR": "€",
"SPWO*L/POUPBD/STERLG": "£",
"SPWO*L/KWREPB": "¥"
```

## Currency Dictionaries

[`currency.json`](https://github.com/didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries/raw/master/dictionaries/currency.json) contains briefs for currency words, such as AUD (`"*AUD": "AUD",`) and dollar (`"SWEUS/TPRAEPBG": "Swiss franc",`), a currency formatting stroke (`"K*RPBS": "{*($c)}",` so you can stroke `34/P-P/5/K*RPBS` to write $34.50), as well as briefs:

* `"TKHRAR": "dollar",`
* `"TKHRARS": "dollars",`
* `"PH-LD": "million dollar",`
* `"PH-LDZ": "million dollars",`
* `"PW-LD": "billion dollar",`
* `"PW-LDZ": "billion dollars",`
* `"TR-LD": "trillion dollar",`
* `"TR-LDZ": "trillion dollars",`

You might also like the related symbols currency dictionary:

- [`symbols-currency.json`](https://github.com/didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries/raw/master/dictionaries/symbols-currency.json) contains briefs for currency symbols, such as cent (`"SPWO*L/KREPBT": "¢"`) and dollar (`"SPWO*L/TKHRAR": "$"`). All of the entries are prefixed with a “symbol” stroke, `"SPWO*L": "{#}"`. The remainder of each entry’s stroke uses the stroke that would write the word instead of the symbol (for example, `"KREPBT": "cent"` and `"TKHRAR": "dollar"`).

## Numbers Dictionaries

- [`numbers.json`](https://github.com/didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries/blob/master/dictionaries/numbers.json) contains the numbers entries from Plover
- [`numbers-powerups.json`](https://github.com/didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries/blob/master/dictionaries/numbers-powerups.json) contains extra entries like:
    ```
    "THOEUB": "{^,000}",
    "THOUZ": "{^000}",
    "THO*UZ": "{,^000}",
    ```

Conflicts:

- [`numbers-powerups.json`](https://github.com/didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries/blob/master/dictionaries/numbers-powerups.json) adds `"K-PL": "km",` and `"K*PL": "{^km}",`, which conflicts with `"K*PL": "kilometer"` added in a more recent version of Plover.

## Australian English Dictionaries

There are used to be two Australian English companion dictionaries, each intended to be used in combination with the default Plover dictionary. There's now only 1.

~~One overrides the default briefs with Australian variations, and also includes Australian prefixes, suffixes, alternative spellings, and vocabulary.  To use this dictionary, copy the [`dict-en-AU.json`](https://github.com/didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries/raw/master/dictionaries/dict-en-AU.json) file into your dictionary folder and add it to your Plover config after the default Plover dictionary so that it overrides default Plover briefs.~~ If you want something like this, copy the current [`dict-en-AU-with-extra-stroke.json`](https://github.com/didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries/raw/master/dictionaries/dict-en-AU-with-extra-stroke.json) and remove the trailing `/A*U` from each outline.

[`dict-en-AU-with-extra-stroke.json`](https://github.com/didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries/raw/master/dictionaries/dict-en-AU-with-extra-stroke.json) uses a kind of suffix stroke, `/A*U`, after every default Plover theory English brief to translate the word to Australian English. For example, to write the American spelling of "empathize", you would stroke `*EPL/THAOEUS`. Then, to write "empathise" you would add `/A*U`. That is, this dictionary’s entry for "empathise" is `"*EPL/THAOEUS/A*U": "empathise",`. To use this dictionary, copy the [`dict-en-AU-with-extra-stroke.json`](https://github.com/didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries/raw/master/dictionaries/dict-en-AU-with-extra-stroke.json) file into your dictionary folder and add it to your Plover config after the default Plover dictionary.

### Notes on Design of and Changes in the Australian English with Extra Strokes Dictionary

- `A*ER/A*U` strokes the "aero" prefix for the Australian spelling of aeroplane
- `*EG/A*U` strokes the "eing" suffix for words such as "ageing"
- `*LG/A*U` strokes the "ling" suffix for words such as "labelling"
- `*LD/A*U` strokes the "led" suffix for words such as "labelled"
- `*EPLT/A*U` strokes the "ement" suffix for words such as "judgement", "acknowledgement", "lodgement" and "abridgement"
- `O*UR/A*U` strokes the "our" suffix for words such as "humour"
- `KWRO*R/A*U` strokes the "iour" suffix for words such as "behaviour"
- Add "U" to `O*R/A*U` or `TPHOR/A*U` strokes for "nour" endings in words such as "honour" e.g. `"HOPB/TPHOUR/A*U": "honour",`
- Add "U" to `O*R/A*U` or `TKOR/A*U` strokes for "dour" endings in words such as "candour" e.g. `"KAPBD/O*UR/A*U": "candour",`
- Add "U" to `O*R/A*U` or `KHROR/A*U` strokes for "our" endings in words such as "colour" e.g. `"KHROUR/A*U": "colour",`

* `"PRAPL": "program",` from Plover
* `"PRAPL/A*U": "programme",` from Aussie extra strokes dictionary
* `"PRA*RPL": "programme",` from Aussie vocab dictionary (this outline is not in Plover)
* `"PRA*RPL/A*U": "programme",` from Aussie extra strokes dictionary
* `"PRA*PL": "param",` from Plover
* `"PRA*PL/A*U": "pram",` from Aussie extra strokes dictionary

### Notes on Design of and Changes in the original, now-deleted Australian English Dictionary

> **Warning**
> The original dictionary this info describes has been removed. You can find it in the git history or follow the steps above to reproduce it.

- `A*ER` strokes the "aero" prefix for the Australian spelling of aeroplane
- `*EG` strokes the "eing" suffix for words such as "ageing"
- `*LG` strokes the "ling" suffix for words such as "labelling"
- `*LD` strokes the "led" suffix for words such as "labelled"
- `*EPLT` strokes the "ement" suffix for words such as "judgement", "acknowledgement", "lodgement" and "abridgement"
- `O*UR` strokes the "our" suffix for words such as "humour"
- `KWRO*R` strokes the "iour" suffix for words such as "behaviour"
- Add "U" to `O*R` or `TPHOR` strokes for "nour" endings in words such as "honour" e.g. `"HOPB/TPHOUR": "honour",`
- Add "U" to `O*R` or `TKOR` strokes for "dour" endings in words such as "candour" e.g. `"KAPBD/O*UR": "candour",`
- Add "U" to `O*R` or `KHROR` strokes for "our" endings in words such as "colour" e.g. `"KHROUR": "colour",`

- For words such as "practice" and "practise", the basic rule is that the noun form uses the "c" spelling while the verb uses the "s" spelling. Therefore, translations have been included for producing both.
    - For example, Australian briefs for "defense" with an "s" will use `S` in the brief itself, while Australian briefs for "defence" with a "c" will drop the `S`, eg, `"TKEFS": "defense"`, `"TKE/TPEPB": "defence"`.
    - As another example, drop the `S` or use `KRE` to spell licence with a "c", eg: `"HR-PB": "licence"`, `"HR-PBS": "license",`
- Use "AE" in strokes for Australian "ae" spellings such as "encyclopaedia":
    - The Australian spelling is used in words stroked with `AE` where it would normally use the long "e" sound stroke `AOE`
    - Briefs form the Australian spelling, eg, "KAOEUPL/RA": "chimaera",
    - Words starting with "ae" can be stroked with the prefix `A` such as `"A/AOE/O*PB": "aeon",`
    - The Australian spelling of "gynaecological" uses briefs and phonetic strokes beginning with `TKPWAOEUPB` => "gyne", while the US spelling uses strokes beginning with `SKWREUPB` => "jyn"

### Australian vocabulary

New briefs have also been added for Australian [diminuitives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminutives_in_Australian_English), flora, fauna, [slang and more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_English_vocabulary). For example:

* `"STRA*EU": "Australia",`
* `"STRA*EU/KWRA": "straya",`
* `"PWOE/TKPWAPB": "bogan",`
* `"RE/PHOFL/EUFT": "removalist",`
* `"STRAO*UT": "strewth",`
* `"HROL/HREU": "lolly",`
* `"TKPWAE/TKAEU": "g'day",`
* `"RAO": "roo",`
* `"PHABG/KAS": "Maccas",`

### Changed Briefs

The brief for "programme" is overridden by "pram", requiring a new brief for "program":

    +"PRAPL": "pram",
    +"PRO/TKPWRAPL": "program",

The `*EG` brief for "e.g." is overridden by the "eing" suffix for the Australian spelling of "ageing", requiring a new brief for "e.g.":

    +"AOE/SKWRAO*E": "e.g.",

## Vim Dictionary

Copy the [`vim.json`](https://github.com/didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries/raw/master/dictionaries/vim.json) file into your dictionary folder and add it to your Plover config to use the following briefs. Note, most strokes use `STPR` to indicate vim (`SR` => `V`):

* `"SREUPL"`: Phonetic brief for "vim".
* `"SR*EUPL"`: Restore brief for "victim" using additional star.
* Punctuation with suppressed spaces to run vim commands (see also: unspaced punctuation dictionary):
    - `"P-P"`: Unspaced period for vim's "last edit" command.
    - `"T*EULD"`: Unspaced tilde for capitalisation. That is, `~`. This brief follows format for tilde `TEULD` with additional star.
    - `"TPHRORB"` => `FLOSH`: Unspaced dollar sign for end of line command.
    - `HR*PB`: Unspaced `<` for left indent.
    - `TKPWR*PB`: Unspaced `>` for right indent.
    - `KW-L`: Unspaced `=`.
    - `OEU`: Unspaced `/` for searching.
* `STPR` and `*`, `-B`, `-G`, `-R` for vim style navigation keys `hjkl`:
    - `"STPR*"`: `h`
    - `"STPR-B"`: `k`
    - `"STPR-G"`: `l`
    - `"STPR-R"`: `j`
    - `"STPR*B"`: `⌃f` to page forward
    - `"STPR*P"`: `⌃b` to page backward

    - `.vimrc` mappings are:

            " Move lines up/down using alt j/k when iTerm is set to:
            " Left option (⌥) key acts as Normal
            " In mapping, press opt/alt+j/k to type these characters
            nnoremap ∆ :m .+1<CR>
            nnoremap ˚ :m .-2<CR>

            inoremap ∆ <Esc>:m .+1<CR>gi
            inoremap ˚ <Esc>:m .-2<CR>gi

            vnoremap ∆ :m '>+1<CR>gv=gv
            vnoremap ˚ :m '<-2<CR>gv=gv

    - Briefs are:
        - `"PHR-B"` => `MLB`: Move line up using vim style navigation `k`.
        - `"PHR-R"` => `MLR`: Move line down using vim style navigation `j`.
* `"SPWAO*UT"`: Exit insert mode and start substitution. That is, Escape and `:%s/`.

* `"STPR*F"`: Exit insert mode and run command to write buffer (i.e. save the file). That is, Escape, `:w`, and Return. This alternative brief format follows brief for Save command `"S*F"` combined with brief format for most of these vim strokes using `STPR`.
* `"STPROEUFRL"`: Steno lookup shortcut that exits insert mode, yanks inside word to system clipboard (this might be Neovim only) using `"yiw` and runs my shortcut for steno lookup tool `⌃⌘⌥⇧s`. Brief format combines vim brief and regular steno lookup brief `STOEUFRL`. To use your own shortcut, replace this part of the translation `{#Control_L(Alt_L(Shift_L(Super_L(s))))}` with your shortcut command.
* `"STPREFBG"`: Exit insert mode and prepare command to write buffer (i.e. save the file) and quit. That is, Escape and `:x`. Brief format follows vim brief format `STPR` and brief for Escape `TPEFBK`.

## Medical Dictionaries

- [medical-suffixes.json](dictionaries/medical-suffixes.json) is inspired by [Odds and Ends | The Plover Blog by Mirabai Knight](http://plover.stenoknight.com/2015/04/odds-and-ends.html)

## Di's Dictionaries

I’ve started marking my custom dictionaries with `di-` or `-di` in the filename. For example, `di-briefs.json` contains my own personal briefs while `briefs.json` contains briefs extracted from `dict.json` that exist in the core Plover dictionary. Ditto with `di-nouns.json` and `nouns.json` as well as `di-proper-nouns.json` and `proper-nouns.json`.

# Contributing

If you notice a misstroke, please mention it. This will help future stenographers learning from Typey Type for Stenographers have a better experience learning stenography. You can use the [Typey Type feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeevsX2oYEvnDHd3y8weg5_7-T8QZsF93ElAo28JO9Tmog-7Q/viewform?usp=sf_link) or [create a new issue](https://github.com/didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries/issues/new) for each misstroke or set of misstrokes you find. Please make a note of the dictionary, misstroke entry, and expected or suggested strokes.

See the [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines to learn more.

## Better briefs

When proposing better briefs, here are some suggestions:

- Check your dictionary for similar strokes. There might be unexpected conflicts around your preferred brief.
- Check your dictionary for similar word beginnings and endings. There might be a set of relevant strokes that suggest a better brief. There might also be similar words that need new briefs at the same time to be consistent.
- Check for potential conflicts or word boundary errors, especially when using strokes used for prefixes or suffixes.
- Ask the [community](http://www.openstenoproject.org/community/) for suggestions.

## Looking for misstrokes

- Words containing "b" with a stroke that is missing P or W is probably a misstroke. You can search for that with a regex like one of these:

```
/.*P[^W]\+[AOEU*-]\+.*": ".*b.*"
/.*[^P]W\+[AOEU*-]\+.*": ".*b.*"
```

- Strokes containing `OEU` that aren't used for "oi" sounds like "boy" or "oil" are probably a misstroke or a brief:

```
/[^A]OEU.*": "[^o][^iy]\+",
```

## Plover’s dictionary

Plover’s [issue 400](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover/issues/400) exists to report suggestions for changing the default dictionary.

Typey Type aims to:

- [Keep in sync with Plover](https://github.com/didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries/issues/1).
- [Avoid getting ahead of issue 400](https://github.com/didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries/pull/2).
- [Remove prominent misstrokes to give new stenographers greater confidence in learning new briefs](https://github.com/didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries/issues/3).

### “Access” and “excess”

As noted in [this comment on issue 400](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover/issues/400#issuecomment-394204080), there are conflicts and inconsistencies around these briefs:

- `"KPESZ": "excess",` 
- `"KPES": "access",`
- `"KPES/S*EUF": "excessive",`
- `"KPES/-BL": "accessible",`
- `"SEBLT": "accessibility",`
- `"KPES/REUS": "accessories",`
- `"SESZ/PAOL": "cesspool",`

It looks to me like:

- "acc-" briefs are generally stroked "A/K…" or sometimes "SE…" while
- "exce-" briefs are generally stroked "KPE…", or "EBGS/" in long form,
- words with a double 's' are sometimes stroked with "SZ", and
- the "SES/PAOL" brief for "cesspool" could be used instead of "SESZ/PAOL",

So I'd suggest:

- "KPES" could be "excess" rather than "access".
- We could create a new brief for "access" using "SESZ".
- We could include briefs that use suffix strokes like "SESZ/-BL" for "accessible".
- We could change "accessory" to "SESZ/REU".
- We could remove "SESZ/PAOL", to avoid word boundaries errors when trying to write "access pool" e.g. "To access pool facilities…", which might otherwise produce "To cesspool facilities…" if `"SESZ"` were "access".

The main briefs might then be:

```JSON
"SESZ": "access",
"SESZ/REU": "accessory",
"SEBL": "accessible",
"SEBLT": "accessibility",
"KPES": "excess",
"KPES/S*EUF": "excessive",
"SES/PAOL": "cesspool",
```

Altogether:

```JSON
"SESZ": "access",
"SESZ/-BL": "accessible",
"SESZ/-BLT": "accessibility",
"SEBL": "accessible",
"SEBLT": "accessibility",
"EUPB/SESZ/-BL": "inaccessible",
"EUPB/SESZ/-BLT": "inaccessibility",
"SESZ/REU": "accessory",
"SESZ/REUS": "accessories",
"SESZ/RAOEUZ": "accessorize",
"KPES": "excess",
"KPES/S*EUF": "excessive",
"SES/PAOL": "cesspool",
```

Removals:

```diff
-"SESZ/PAOL": "cesspool",
-"KPES": "access",
-"KPES/-BL": "accessible",
-"KPES/REUS": "accessories",
-"KPES/TO": "access to",
```

If these changes are merged in Plover’s default dictionary, we can restore these to [briefs.json]:

```
"KPES": "excess",
"KPESZ": "excess",
"KP*ES": "excess",
"SESZ": "access",
"SESZ/-BL": "accessible",
"SESZ/-BLT": "accessibility",
"SEBL": "accessible",
"SEBLT": "accessibility",
"SEUBLT": "accessibility",
```

### “Honour”

Default Plover does not have an entry for `"HO*URPB": "honour"`, so the only way to stroke this entry in Typey Type is to use the [Australian English dictionary](https://github.com/didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries#australian-english-dictionaries) or fingerspell. [If "honour" gets added upstream in Plover, then great, and this entry can be re-changed to "HO*URPB": "honour".](https://github.com/didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries/pull/14#issuecomment-446552793).
